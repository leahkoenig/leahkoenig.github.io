I am a PhD candidate in Epidemiology and Translational Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.ansirh.org/">Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health</a> team at UCSF. I apply quantitative research methods to policy-relevant issues in reproductive health. My current research examines the safety, effectiveness, patient experience, and health equity implications of novel methods of abortion care.
